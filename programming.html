    <H6>Codebreakers are diverse individuals, including mathematicians, linguists, and enthusiasts, who use skills in
        pattern recognition, mathematics, and persistence to decipher secret communications. Historically, their work
        was vital in conflicts like WWI and WWII, from breaking the German Enigma code to disrupting spy rings, but they
        were also a key part of modern intelligence, with many continuing their work in organizations like the NSA and
        GCHQ. Their work required intense secrecy, with some <b>codebreakers not able to discuss their jobs with
            colleagues</b> or family for decades. </H6>
